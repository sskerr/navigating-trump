        <p class="intro"> Do you like avocados? Tecate Beer? Congratulations! You may soon be contributing to America’s next big infrastructure project: the southern border wall. </p>
        <p> In January, the Trump administration indicated that it is considering a plan to levy a 20 percent tax on all goods imported from Mexico. While hurting Mexican industries, this tax would also directly affect American consumers, many of whom unknowingly
            consume products from Mexico every day. </p>
        <p> So how much would you pay for the wall through what you normally eat and drink? </p>

        <p class="intro">Disgusted? Happy? Sad? Whatever your politics, the number may come as a surprise. After floating this idea, the Trump administration walked it back, stating that it was one of many ideas currently on the table. </p>

        <p> Now, three months later, Republicans are eyeing tax reform as their next big priority and a call for proposals to design the new border wall closed earlier this week. </p>

        <p>Constanza Gallardo, 26, a Mexican graduate student studying in New York City was unnerved by the idea that buying products from Mexico might directly pay for the border wall in the future, a project she does not support.</p>

        <p>“It would be a personal struggle,” said Gallardo. "Because you want to buy these things because you love to eat them and some money would go to Mexico. So, in some ways I am helping my country but in other ways I am helping to build the border
            wall.” </p>

        <p>In a report put out by The Tax Foundation, a non-partition tax policy research institute, tax expert Kyle Pomerleau writes that the new import taxes on Mexican goods would likely come with a host of sweeping changes that would revamp the way companies
            pay income tax in the United States. </p>

        <blockquote id="line" class="thick-line">
            In some ways I am helping my country but in other ways, I am helping to build the border wall.” <span id="pq-byline"> Contanza Gallardo, 26</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p> In the unlikely event this happens, Pomerleau establishes that the burden of the new import tax may also not be passed on to consumers in the long-term.
            <p> "...the literature suggests that exchange rates would adjust, but it could take time for that to translate through prices. As a result, the tax could fall on consumers and producers in the short run," writes Pomerleau. </p>

            <p> Beyond grocery items and alcohol, Mexico also exports large quantities of car parts, chemicals, clothing and other goods to the United States. Therefore, beyond food consumption, contributions from individuals would likely be higher. </p>

            <p>So while it is currently unclear if the administration will move forward with a border tax, the question of who will pay for the wall also remains anyone’s guess. </p>
